### Hi there, I'm Kiran Babu Muddam ðŸ‘‹

Motivated computer science undergraduate with a passion towards distributed systems and API development. Well-versed in writing clean and scalable code using extensive problem-solving skills. If you had an awesome job role for me, don't hesitate to message me. 

### I'm currently working on... ðŸ”¨

[**TIGMINT**](https://github.com/Yajassardana/TIGMINT)- The increase in the consumption of social media is directly related to the number of online crimes happening through social media or misusing social media. It is impossible to trace and act against every crime without the help of automation and the latest technological advances. Considering the large amount of data generated using these social networks it is nowhere possible to manually analyze information. OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) tools are often used to gather different kinds of information from social networks. But these tools are complex to use and require a lot of technical expertise. So, to tackle this problem we made a tool which can be used by LEAâ€™s (Law Enforcement Agencies) to analyze social media information. This tool implements abstraction mechanisms to hide the background technical complexity and bundles different analysis techniques for social networks together providing a simple intuitive web interface for
the user to work with. [**check it out**](https://github.com/Yajassardana/TIGMINT)!
